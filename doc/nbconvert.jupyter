    # Notebook format conversions with `nbconvert`
    
    During the installation of `jupyter_format`
    (see [Installation](installation.jupyter)),
    so-called "entry points" for `nbconvert` are configured automatically.
    
    You can convert `.ipynb` notebooks to `.jupyter`,
    just as you are used to, with
    
        python3 -m nbconvert --to jupyter my-old-notebook.ipynb
    
    And you can convert in the other direction,
    from `.jupyter` back to `.ipynb`
    
        python3 -m nbconvert --to notebook my-new-notebook.jupyter
    
    You can also convert from `.jupyter` files directly
    to any of the output formats that `nbconvert` supports:
    
        python3 -m nbconvert --to html my-new-notebook.jupyter
markdown
    So let's try it with this very notebook, shall we?
code
    !python3 -m nbconvert --to notebook nbconvert.jupyter --output=my-new-notebook
markdown
    Just to make sure it is actually using Jupyter's JSON format,
    let's peek at the beginning of the file:
code
    !head my-new-notebook.ipynb
markdown
    Here's a link to the new file for your perusal:
    [my-new-notebook.ipynb](my-new-notebook.ipynb).
    
    Not let's convert this back to `.jupyter`:
code
    !python3 -m nbconvert --to jupyter my-new-notebook.ipynb
markdown
    Again, we take a peek:
code
    !head my-new-notebook.jupyter
markdown
    And a link for closer inspection:
    [my-new-notebook.jupyter](my-new-notebook.jupyter).
    
    Finally, let's try to convert this `.jupyter` file to an HTML page:
code
    !python3 -m nbconvert --to html my-new-notebook.jupyter
code
    from IPython.display import IFrame
    IFrame('my-new-notebook.html', width='100%', height=350)
markdown
    And for completeness' sake, a link:
    [my-new-notebook.html](my-new-notebook.html).
